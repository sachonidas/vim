# Config file to nvim to IDE

I follow the next guide to build this file and add others plugins or change keymaps:

https://thevaluable.dev/vim-php-ide/#refactoring-plugins


# VIM or NVIM

I make this file with NVIM but you can use VIM too.


# Install

Before start to make this file, you need to install vim-plug:

https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug

Then you can add all of the plugins or more if you need (or less) and when you finish 
launch but first, save this file :wq and then launch:

``` :PlugInstall ```

# Air line
The air line provide you information of the file but this is my theme, there are others with differents icons, features, etc.
You can find them in:

https://github.com/vim-airline/vim-airline-themes

Search your favourite and set it in the init.nvim

# How to use

Open a new terminal, change to your code directory and launch nvim or vim.
After that I launch the File search in the normal mode with space bar and 'p' and find the file that I'm going to edit.
Or you can use ctrl+T and toggle the NERDTree directory and search your files.

This is my way to use, you can use your methods.


Enjoy!
